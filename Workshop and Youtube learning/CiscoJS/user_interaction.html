<!-- Most of the programs we deal with on a daily basis are dependent on user interaction. 
The user enters data, makes choices, and confirms the options given by the program. 
Thanks to this interaction, 
the program can start to use the data that is provided to it by the user during its execution 
(this data was not known when the program was started, nor was it known when it was written). 
Secondly, the program can perform certain actions conditionally, 
in other words, the user influences not only the data, but also its execution.

A simple example is the calculator program. The user not only enters data (e.g. the numbers 10 and 20), 
but also decides what to do with it (e.g. sum up).

In the case of JS, interaction with the user is quite a complex topic. This is for several reasons.
Do you remember that we can write programs in this language both for use in the browser (client-side) 
and to perform certain actions on the server-side? 
This division influences the potential interaction. 
JS programs written with node.js for servers usually do not require such an interaction. 
We run them from the console level, often without a graphic environment.

This is definitely different for client-side applications. 
In most cases, they require continuous interaction between the user and the program. 
Using them, we can click on buttons, enter values into forms, select data from drop-down lists, and so on. 
The problem is that practically all elements used for this purpose are HTML components. 
Using them may not be very difficult, 
but it does require at least a thorough understanding of the basics of the DOM (Document Object Model) 
used in web pages, and the basics of HTML itself. 

An example of an HTML page that uses two elements for interaction, for which JavaScript code is used, is shown below: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <input id="myID" type="text">
    <button onclick="console.log(document.getElementById('myID').value)">Get Text</button>
</body>
</html>
